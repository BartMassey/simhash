Summary: many fixes, debugging
Keywords: buggy

fixed the compare score format to %4.2f
added a debugging trace option and tools
fixed a hideous bug in that the heap was being abused
fixed another hideous bug in that the comparison was
  going from the wrong end

comparing a big hash with a small hash still doesn't
  score 100%, so something still broke
