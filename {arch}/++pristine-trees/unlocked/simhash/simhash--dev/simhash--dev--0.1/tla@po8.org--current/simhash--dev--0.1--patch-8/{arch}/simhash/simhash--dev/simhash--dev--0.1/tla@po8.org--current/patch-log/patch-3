Summary: argument parsing improvements to adjust params
Keywords: buggy

Argument parsing and program structure changed to allow
specification of shingle size and feature set size.  Now
malloc()s the memory used.

Still has fundamental problems with the actual scoring
metric---need to reread the paper, I guess.
